# NASA's Human Exploration Research Analog
During my time working as a Data Science Intern at the [SONIC Research Group](https://sonic.northwestern.edu/), I was captivated by the effect of Shared Mental Models (SMMs), or collective cognition in team functioning, on individual, team, and multiteam system (MTS) performances. In this research, I collected data across 2 campaigns and 9 missions from the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA)â€™s [Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA)](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/hera/), where participants spend 45 days in isolated, confined habitats simulating an outer space mission. I the analyzed collected data from 25 sessions of a computer-based MTS decision-making lab experiment called Project RED (Red planet, Exploration, and Design), which was executed by the HERA crew working collaboratively with an offsite ground-support crew, forming a 12-person MTS. This study relies heavily on **contextualized performances**, which are team-level performances measured as a combination of their contribution to team (ToT) or multiteam system (MoT) oriented goals through multi-objective optimization. 

In short, this research follows a three-step approach:
1. I calculated the Euclidean distance between designated survey responses to measure the strength of team- and task-related shared cognition.
2. I generated binary network ties by comparing with session-level averages and performed descriptive analysis.
3. I fine-tuned and interpreted ALAAM models to investigate how the SMMs network influences contextualized performances.

Special thanks to Megan Chan, Dr. Leslie DeChurch, and Dr. Noshir Contractor for their guidance and research assistance, Dr. Leslie DeChurch and Dr. Alina Lungeanu for their leading discoveries in shared team cognition, and NASA HERA for providing the classified data.

## Repository Descriptions

>[!NOTE]
>Since the research involves classified human data, this repository contains only code snippets that can be made available to the public.
