# NASA's Human Exploration Research Analog
During my time working as a Data Science Intern at the [SONIC Research Group](https://sonic.northwestern.edu/), I was captivated by the effect of Shared Mental Models (SMMs), or collective cognition in team functioning, on individual, team, and multiteam system (MTS) performances. In this research, I collected data across 2 campaigns and 9 missions from the National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA)â€™s Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA), where participants spend 45 days in isolated, confined habitats simulating an outer space mission. I the analyzed collected data from 25 sessions of a computer-based MTS decision-making lab experiment called Project RED (Red planet, Exploration, and Design), which was executed by the HERA crew working collaboratively with an offsite ground-support crew, forming a 12-person MTS. This study relies heavily on **contextualized performances**, which are individual-level performances measured as a combination of their contribution to individual (IoI), team (ToI), and multiteam system (MoI) through multi-objective optimization. 

In short, this research follows a three-step approach:
1. I calculated the Euclidean distance between designated survey responses to measure the strength of team- and task-related shared cognition.
2. I generated binary network ties by comparing with session-level averages and performed descriptive analysis.
3. I fine-tuned and interpreted ALAAM models to investigate how the SMMs network influences contextualized performances.
